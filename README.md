Alarmclock on a Raspberry Pi with a touch display

NOTE: this is works in progress!

# Motivation

I wanted to have a Raspberry Pi based alarm clock that can replace my simple radio clock.
It should
* have a decent time display inspired by flip clocks
* have a touch UI interface allowing to enable/disable the alarm and define the alarm time
* have a configurable alarm sound (mp3 file or stream). This is not necessary via the touch UI
* run on Raspberry Pi model one. I still have some and a simple alarm clock should not need more resources

# Material

* Raspberry Pi
* 7" TFT LCD touch display [RASPBERRY PI 7TD](https://www.reichelt.de/raspberry-pi-shield-display-lcd-touch-7-800x480-pixel-raspberry-pi-7td-p159859.html)
* SD card with [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) buster
